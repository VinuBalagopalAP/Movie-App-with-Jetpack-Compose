# Movie App with Jetpack Compose

* The app consists of two screens:
  * HomeScreen -> Movies are listed here.
  * DetailScreen -> An in-depth review of each movie can be found here.
* Navigation is done by navController, which passes data as arguments.
* For reusability, the model's data class was created and widgets were separated
